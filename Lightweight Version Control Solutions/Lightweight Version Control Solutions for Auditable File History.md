# Lightweight Version Control Solutions for Auditable File History

There are several open-source projects – many written in Go – that can provide a lightweight self-hosted version control service focusing on file history and audit trails. Below we outline a few suitable solutions, highlighting their key features relative to your requirements (versioned file history, auditability, container deployable, minimal overhead, etc.).

## Gitea (Go) – Self-Hosted Git Service

Gitea is a popular lightweight, self-hosted Git service written in Go[[1]](https://rawkode.academy/technology/gitea/#:~:text=Gitea%20is%20a%20lightweight%2C%20self,management%2C%20and%20creating%20isolated%20Git). It aims to be a painless way to host Git repositories with minimal resources, while still offering core version-control features (commit history, branches) and optional extras (issues, pull requests, etc.) similar to GitHub[[1]](https://rawkode.academy/technology/gitea/#:~:text=Gitea%20is%20a%20lightweight%2C%20self,management%2C%20and%20creating%20isolated%20Git). Key points about Gitea:

* **Open Source & Lightweight:** Gitea is open-source (MIT/AGPL license) and designed to run efficiently even on modest hardware (it’s known to run on a Raspberry Pi)[[2]](https://rawkode.academy/technology/gitea/#:~:text=environments,powered%20servers)[[3]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/159142/time-to-move-to-self-hosted-git-solution#:~:text=I%20used%20Gogs%20in%20a,maybe%20it%20is%20easier%20now). It’s distributed as a single binary, easy to deploy via Docker or directly on any OS that Go supports.
* **Versioning and Audit Logs:** Being Git-based, Gitea tracks a full history of commits. Every change has an associated author, timestamp, and commit message (“who changed what and when” is inherent to Git). The commit history is append-only by default, so as long as you avoid force-pushing or disable it, the log of changes remains immutable. Gitea also provides a web UI to browse file history and commits, or you can use Git CLI/API to query history.
* **CLI and API Access:** You can interact with Gitea via standard Git CLI (SSH/HTTPS) and a REST API. This suits single-user scripting or automation if you don’t need the web UI. In single-user mode, you could just create one account or use the built-in admin, and skip complex access control.
* **Storage Backend:** Gitea **does require a filesystem** (or mounted volume) for storing git repository data. It does not *natively* support using S3/Azure Blob for the git repo storage as of now (object storage can only be used for attachments, LFS objects, etc.)[[4]](https://forum.gitea.com/t/how-to-config-s3-minio-to-store-repositories/3105#:~:text=It%20is%20not%20,and%20a%20few%20other%20things). This means you’d likely store repos on local disk (within the container or a mounted volume) and optionally back up that volume to S3. (There is ongoing development in the community around object storage, but currently repo storage on S3 isn’t available[[4]](https://forum.gitea.com/t/how-to-config-s3-minio-to-store-repositories/3105#:~:text=It%20is%20not%20,and%20a%20few%20other%20things).)

Overall, Gitea is a strong candidate if you want a full Git experience in a lightweight package. It gives you immutable Git commit history (satisfying audit needs) and can be run easily in a container[[5]](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1cjr8f5/free_softwares_to_be_used_for_version_control_on/#:~:text=arijitlive). The extra GitHub-like features can be ignored if not needed – you can simply use it as a minimal Git server for version control.

## Gogs (Go) – Minimal GitHub-Like Server

Gogs is another open-source Git server written in Go, and in fact Gitea began as a community fork of Gogs[[6]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/159142/time-to-move-to-self-hosted-git-solution#:~:text=I%27m%20using%20Gogs%2C%20which%20Gitea,I%20still%20need%20to%20migrate). Gogs markets itself as a **“painless self-hosted Git service”**, emphasizing simplicity and low resource usage[[7]](https://awsmfoss.com/gogs/#:~:text=,party%20hosting%20providers). Consider Gogs if you want an even more stripped-down service:

* **Lightweight and Simple:** Gogs is extremely lightweight – just a single Go binary, efficient and cross-platform. It can be quickly deployed with minimal config, and has very low resource requirements (suitable for small VMs or even devices like Raspberry Pi)[[7]](https://awsmfoss.com/gogs/#:~:text=,party%20hosting%20providers). Users report that Gogs/Gitea are *“fast and light”* compared to heavier alternatives[[3]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/159142/time-to-move-to-self-hosted-git-solution#:~:text=I%20used%20Gogs%20in%20a,maybe%20it%20is%20easier%20now). For example, one user noted Gogs provided all the essential features their project needed while being *“very light-weight”* in usage[[6]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/159142/time-to-move-to-self-hosted-git-solution#:~:text=I%27m%20using%20Gogs%2C%20which%20Gitea,I%20still%20need%20to%20migrate).
* **Core Features Only:** It supports the basics of Git repository hosting – browsing code, commit history, etc. – and also includes optional features like a wiki, issue tracker, and basic access control. However, it doesn’t aim to match the full feature set of GitLab/GitHub, which keeps it lean[[6]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/159142/time-to-move-to-self-hosted-git-solution#:~:text=I%27m%20using%20Gogs%2C%20which%20Gitea,I%20still%20need%20to%20migrate). This sounds aligned with your note that “the rest of Git capabilities are not important.” Gogs focuses on version control and leaves out heavy integrated CI/CD or project management features.
* **Deployment:** Like Gitea, Gogs can run in a container easily (the project provides a Docker image). It uses a lightweight embedded web server and can use SQLite (or MySQL/Postgres) for metadata. Single-user operation is easy (you can disable registrations and just use one account).
* **Auditability:** As a Git-backed service, Gogs also relies on Git commits for history. Every commit will record the user identity (author) and timestamp. Gogs doesn’t allow anonymous pushes – you’d commit with your user, so the “who/when” is captured in each commit. The Git history is immutable unless someone intentionally erases or rewrites history (which you can avoid or detect). There isn’t a separate audit log beyond Git, but Git’s own log serves that purpose.

In summary, Gogs is a good fit if you want the absolute lightest Git server. It trades off some features for simplicity but still provides an auditable version history through Git commits. (If choosing between Gogs and Gitea: Gitea has a larger community and more ongoing updates, whereas Gogs is very stable and minimal. Both have similar deployment and resource profiles, being written in Go and single-binary solutions[[6]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/159142/time-to-move-to-self-hosted-git-solution#:~:text=I%27m%20using%20Gogs%2C%20which%20Gitea,I%20still%20need%20to%20migrate).)

## lakeFS (Go) – Version Control on Object Storage

If your environment leans toward using cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.) as the backend, **lakeFS** is an innovative option. lakeFS is an open-source service (written in Go) that treats an object store like a Git repository – it brings Git-like versioning semantics to data lakes and file storage[[8]](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS#:~:text=lakeFS%20is%20an%20open,way%20you%20manage%20your%20code). Key highlights:

* **Git-Like Versioning for Files:** lakeFS lets you create repositories on top of cloud object storage. You can commit changes, create branches, and tag versions of data in your S3/Azure storage just as you would in Git[[8]](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS#:~:text=lakeFS%20is%20an%20open,way%20you%20manage%20your%20code). Every file added or modified is tracked in a commit. This means you get a full history of *what changed and when*, across all files, with commit IDs.
* **Object Storage Backend:** It **natively supports AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage** as the underlying storage for file data[[9]](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS#:~:text=lakeFS%20supports%20AWS%20S3%2C%20Azure,Hive%2C%20AWS%20Athena%2C%20DuckDB%2C%20and). This aligns perfectly with your “ideal” scenario of using S3/Azure as a backend. The metadata (commit history, refs, etc.) is managed by lakeFS, but the bulk data lives in your cloud bucket. This also makes it easy to scale storage and achieve durability.
* **Audit and Immutability:** LakeFS is explicitly designed to provide an audit trail on data changes. It maintains an immutable commit log of all changes. In fact, the **commit log serves as a comprehensive audit trail, giving complete visibility into what data changed, by whom, and when**[[10]](https://lakefs.io/blog/lakefs-data-compliance/#:~:text=How%20lakeFS%20Helps%20Ensure%20Data,lakeFS%20makes%20it). You can list all commits, see the author and timestamp, and even enforce controls like requiring a commit to go through a workflow (“Write-Audit-Publish” pattern for data governance). Because commits are immutable, you get tamper-evident history – old versions remain accessible and cannot be silently altered.
* **Usage and Overhead:** LakeFS can be run as a single Docker container (there’s an official image for quickstart). It provides a web UI and an API/CLI. It is somewhat heavier than Gitea/Gogs because it deals with potentially large data and offers transaction support for commits, but if your use-case is managing files in cloud storage with auditability, the trade-off is that it *simplifies tracking data in S3/Azure with Git-like ease*. It’s used in data engineering contexts, but you can version-control any files (not just big data) with it. One consideration: lakeFS isn’t a Git server for code, so it doesn’t support textual diff/merge in the same way Git does – it treats files as blobs. If you only need linear history (and perhaps branching) for file versions, that’s fine.

In short, lakeFS is a strong choice if you want **first-class integration with S3/Azure and built-in auditing**. It gives you an append-only history of file changes on object storage[[10]](https://lakefs.io/blog/lakefs-data-compliance/#:~:text=How%20lakeFS%20Helps%20Ensure%20Data,lakeFS%20makes%20it), fulfilling the “who/what/when” auditing requirement and storing data in the cloud backend of your choice[[9]](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS#:~:text=lakeFS%20supports%20AWS%20S3%2C%20Azure,Hive%2C%20AWS%20Athena%2C%20DuckDB%2C%20and).

## Immudb (Go) – Immutable Data Ledger (Auditing-Focused)

For a more specialized take on auditability, consider **Immudb** – an open-source **immutable database (ledger)** written in Go. Immudb is not a version control system per se, but rather a tamper-proof database that keeps *verifiable history* of all changes[[11]](https://immudb.io/#:~:text=Tamper%20Protection)[[12]](https://immudb.io/#:~:text=Data%20Change%20History). It can be used to build a custom versioned storage service with strong audit guarantees:

* **Append-Only, Tamper-Proof:** Immudb is designed so that data can only be added, never modified or deleted in-place[[13]](https://immudb.io/#:~:text=Tamper%20Protection). Every entry (and transaction) is cryptographically verified and chained, similar to a blockchain but lightweight. This guarantees that once a record is written, it’s immutable and any attempt to tamper would be detectable[[11]](https://immudb.io/#:~:text=Tamper%20Protection). For your use-case, this means an *immutable log of changes*: you could store each file version or change as an entry and be assured no one can alter the historical records.
* **Historical Queries:** It supports **versioned and temporal queries**, allowing you to query past states of data easily[[14]](https://immudb.io/#:~:text=Cryptographical%20client,queries%20subject%20to%20cryptographic%20verification). The tagline is *“travel back in time and understand how your data has changed”*, with the ability to produce audit reports of all changes[[12]](https://immudb.io/#:~:text=Data%20Change%20History). This aligns perfectly with the requirement for auditability.
* **Integration & Usage:** Immudb exposes both key-value and SQL interfaces. You might use a key-value scheme where each file (identified by a path or ID) maps to its latest content, and historical versions are kept automatically by the ledger. Or use SQL tables for file metadata and content. Using immudb would require a bit of integration work (unlike Gitea/Gogs which are turn-key for Git). For example, you’d write a small application or scripts to push file changes into immudb and retrieve versions. There isn’t a built-in “Git-like” client for files – *you* define how to version your files in the database. On the flip side, immudb provides client libraries and a REST gateway, and it’s built to be embedded or run as a service in a container.
* **Audit Use-Case:** If the paramount concern is a bulletproof audit log of changes (who/when/what) above all else, immudb delivers that with cryptographic proofs[[11]](https://immudb.io/#:~:text=Tamper%20Protection). You would, however, need to create a convention for tracking “who” (e.g. include a username in each transaction or as part of the record data, since immudb itself doesn’t have user accounts tied to writes). In a single-user scenario this might not matter, but it’s flexible to support multi-user auditing if needed (with your app logic).

In summary, immudb is worth considering if you are open to a lower-level solution that you can tailor for an **unalterable audit log** of file changes. It’s a different approach (more a secure ledger than a traditional VCS), but it ensures no capability of history rewriting and provides verifiable proofs of each change – ideal for stringent audit requirements[[12]](https://immudb.io/#:~:text=Data%20Change%20History). It’s container-friendly and open source. Keep in mind you’ll need to build a bit of your own logic on top to manage files (there’s no built-in “file versioning” UI/CLI, just the database APIs).

## Restic (Go) – Lightweight Backup with File History

If a full version-control system is more complexity than you need, an alternative is to use a backup tool like **Restic** (or its cousin Kopia) to achieve file versioning and history. **Restic** is an open-source backup program written in Go[[15]](https://prinzpiuz.in/post/my_backup_strategies_part2/#:~:text=Restic%20is%20a%20modern%20backup,incremental%20backups%2C%20and%20verifiable%20backups) that inherently supports deduplicated snapshots, retention of history, and storing data in various backends (including local disk, S3, Azure Blob, etc.). Key considerations for restic:

* **Snapshot-Based Version History:** Restic treats each backup operation as creating a **snapshot** of your files (which can be an entire directory tree). Snapshots are content-addressed and **incremental**, so they only store differences efficiently. Each snapshot is timestamped, and you can give them tags or hostnames to identify the source. By running restic regularly (or whenever files change), you’d build up a history of snapshots – effectively versions of your files over time.
* **Audit Information:** In a basic setup, restic records the time of each snapshot and the machine/user who ran it (the hostname and username can be stored). For a single-user scenario, every snapshot is implicitly “you”, but you could simulate multi-user attribution by using tags or separate repositories per user. To answer “who changed what, when”: you would compare snapshots. Restic has a restic diff <snap1> <snap2> command to list which files were added/modified/deleted between two snapshots. While it’s not as granular as a line-by-line diff in code, it does let you see *what files changed between versions*. The “who” would correspond to whichever process or tag created the snapshot (which, again, in a simple use is just you or an automated job).
* **Storage Backends and Immutability:** Restic natively supports a wide range of storage backends. You can store the backup repository in **AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, any S3-compatible service (like MinIO), or even an SFTP server or local disk**[[15]](https://prinzpiuz.in/post/my_backup_strategies_part2/#:~:text=Restic%20is%20a%20modern%20backup,incremental%20backups%2C%20and%20verifiable%20backups). This flexibility meets your preference for S3/Azure. The repository data is encrypted and deduplicated. By default, restic never deletes snapshots unless you run an explicit prune/forget command, so the history is effectively append-only (immutable) unless you choose to clean old data. If you simply never prune, every snapshot remains forever, providing an audit trail of changes. You could even restrict repository access to prevent deletion if needed.
* **Lightweight & CLI-Only:** Restic is just a command-line tool (no always-running server component). You’d run it in a container (possibly via a Cron job or triggered by a commit hook in your workflow) to capture file states. The absence of a constant server makes it **very lightweight** on resources – it consumes CPU/memory only when running a backup or restoring. It’s ideal if you’re comfortable with a CLI solution and perhaps scripting around it. For example, you could spin up a container that runs restic backup daily and pushes to S3. Retrieving history is done via CLI as well (restic snapshots to list versions, restic diff or restore to inspect or recover files from a point in time).
* **Considerations:** Restic is geared towards backup use-cases, so it doesn’t have multi-user collaboration features or locking. If two people ran restic on the same repo simultaneously, they’d just add two snapshots. There’s no concept of merging changes – each snapshot is a separate state. This is fine for audit/history purposes (you’d just see potentially two snapshots around the same time). Also, to see *who* made a change, you’ll rely on naming conventions (e.g., have separate repos or tags per person, since the repository itself doesn’t enforce user identity). In a single-user context, this is a non-issue.

In essence, **restic provides “version control by snapshots”** – a simple way to keep every historical version of files with minimal infrastructure. It satisfies the requirement of seeing file history (with timestamp and logical user attribution) and uses cloud storage as a backend out-of-the-box. It’s a great fit if you prefer something that “just stores versions of files” without needing a full Git model. (Another similar tool is **Kopia**, also written in Go, which offers a client-server mode and even a GUI, but conceptually it’s like restic – snapshots of file sets with cloud storage support.)

## Other Noteworthy Mentions

* **Fossil SCM (C)** – Not written in Go, but worth mentioning: Fossil is an ultra-lightweight distributed version control system created by the SQLite author. It’s a single binary (compiled C) that includes source control, wiki, and issue tracking in one. Fossil uses an SQLite database to store the repo, and it has a built-in web interface for browsing history. It’s known to be *extremely* light on resources – users report it can run with ~2 MB of RAM usage while still handling all core version control functions[[16]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/159142/time-to-move-to-self-hosted-git-solution#:~:text=Installation%20was%20actually%20a%20bit,maybe%20it%20is%20easier%20now). Every commit is tracked with author and time (like Git), and it’s *append-only* (Fossil keeps all historical artifacts; it doesn’t allow history rewriting easily, which bolsters auditability). The downside is that Fossil is not Git-compatible, so you and collaborators would have to use Fossil’s tools/commands. If you don’t mind stepping outside the Git ecosystem, Fossil in single-user mode could meet your needs with virtually no overhead. (It’s also open source, BSD licensed.)
* **Mercurial or Others** – Mercurial (hg) is another DVCS known for simplicity, but it’s written in Python and not as lightweight as Go solutions, and usually needs a bit more setup for a server (e.g., hgweb or RhodeCode). Given your preferences (container, Go, etc.), it’s probably not as attractive. Similarly, newer DVCS like *Pijul (Rust)* or *Jujutsu (Rust)* exist, but they are more experimental or geared toward client-side use and would require additional tools to serve as an auditable service.
